MtB also could be taken as a use of reason and also a disciplining of the senses to focus on beauty (i.e. all the pretty flowers, all the pretty birds). (Update 3-16-21 -This is one of the first 4 points created because they were on the top of my mind when I first started this project. Maximize the Beauty and Full Expression still are some of the concepts I am most influenced by, create an ethos around, consider to be primary to my concept of virtue, and aim to implement as much as possible.)",

      "5) Various meditation - I am a big fan of meditation techniques that help train the mind from moment to moment. There are various techniques that help provide concentration and awareness in the passing moments within shorter intervals than traditional formal meditation. While using a timer to make sure you meditate for at least 10 minutes is helpful. A stopwatch to monitor your awareness of time and to also use time to monitor your concentration and awareness. A and C are essential to have Full Expression. Update 2-26-19 - Passive observation ala Krishnamurti. Just chill. Dont do anything. Just observe whatever is present. Don't react to thoughts just observe them. Don't interact with them. If they are mind blowing write them down. Then return to just chilling and observing.", "chill", "rational"
